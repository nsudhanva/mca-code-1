<h1>INSTRUCTIONS:</h1>

<br><u>STEP 1:</u>

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Prepare the cake pans: grease and flour two 8 or 9-inch pans, and line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper.

<br><u>STEP 2:</u>

In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Set aside.

<br><u>STEP 3:</u>

In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the eggs, oil, two sugars and vanilla. Beat on low speed for about 30 seconds, and then turn up the speed to medium for about 2 to 3 minutes, or until combined and lightly frothy.

<br><u>STEP 8:</u>

While the cake cools, prepare the cream cheese icing. Cream the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer, mixing on medium speed until completely combined and fluffy. Stir in the vanilla and 2 cups of the confectioners’ sugar. Mix on low speed, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining sugar, and mix until the icing has reached your desired consistency.

<br><u>STEP 9:</u>

Once the cake is cooled completely, place one cake layer, flat side up, on a serving platter, and spread 1/2 to 3/4 cup of frosting on top. Place the second cake layer, flat side up, on top of the frosted layer. Apply a thin crumb coat, and let it set in the refrigerator for 10 minutes before proceeding to ice the top and sides. Decorate as desired.
