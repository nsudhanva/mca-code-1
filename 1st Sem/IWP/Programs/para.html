This is a picture of a Airplane. The plane is the flagship single-engine Cessna aircraft. Although the airplane began as a four-place aircraft, it soon acquired a third row of seats, stretching it to a six-place plane. The airplane is classified as a high-performance airplane, which means its landing gear is retractable and its engine has more than 200 horsepower. In its first model year, which was 1960,the airplane was powered by a 260-horsepower fuel-injected six-cylinder engine that displaced 471 cubic inches.The airplane is the fastest single-engine airplane ever built by Cessna.  <br />
