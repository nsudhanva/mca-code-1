      Abraham Lincoln is generally regarded as one of the greatest
      presidents of the United States. 
    </p>
     <p>His most famous speech was 
      delivered in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, during the Civil War.
      This speech began with 
       </p> 
             <blockquote>
              "Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on
               this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and 
               dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
               
      <p> 
        Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
        that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
        can long endure." 
      </p>
          </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      Whatever one's opinion of Lincoln, no one can deny the 
      enormous and lasting effect he had on the United States.
