Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Amazon VPC

Benefits - 
1) Define Custom Networks
2) Assign static private IPv4 address to instances.
3) Define network interface and attach one or more network interface to the instances.
4) Define the routing between different subnets.
5) Define network security by allowing and denying the traffic.
6) Control the outbound traffic along with inbound traffic.

VPC Key Concepts - A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. To launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.
To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists (ACL).
