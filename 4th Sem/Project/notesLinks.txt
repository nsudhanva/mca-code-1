Courier services are designed to be as efficient as possible, which requires multiple steps on a large scale.
The first step is the one that most senders are familiar with. When you book a courier service online with Parcel2Go, 
your courier will come and collect the parcel you’ve booked either from a specific address — that could be your place of 
work or your home — or from a drop-off location.
From there, the courier will take your parcel (along with hundreds of others collected that same day) to the nearest depot. 

At the depot, you parcel is sorted with others that are addressed to a similar area. Parcels will often be sent to 
another depot closer to the delivery location, where it will be assigned to a driver based on their area of coverage.
The next driver takes your parcel from the depot and delivers it to the recipient on his or her delivery route.
