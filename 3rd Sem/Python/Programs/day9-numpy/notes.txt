NumPy which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimesional array objects and a collection of sub routines.
NumPy enriches the programming language Python with powerful data structures, implementing multidimesional arrays and matrices.
Why NumPy - it internally stores data in contiguous block of memory, independent of other built-in Python Objects.
Numpy operations perform complex computations on entire array without use of for loop.
At the core, numpy provides the excellent ndarray objects, short for n-dimensional arrays.

arrays support vectorised operations, while lists dont
once an array is created, you cannot change its size. You will have to create a new array or overwrite it.
